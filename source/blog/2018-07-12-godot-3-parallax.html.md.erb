2D parallax effects are a staple in video games. 
Here we discuss how to create a parallax effect in Godot, a FOSS game engine.
We also create a parallax background using GIMP, a FOSS image editer.

## Creating an image

We're going to start off with a free image from [open game art](https://opengameart.org/content/spacebackgrounds-0) that looks cool, but does not work well for a parallax background.
Download the image and open it up in GIMP.
In the top toolbar, go to `Layer > Transform > Offset`.
Click the 'chain' icon (if it's present) to make it a broken chain, and then set x offset to 600.


<%= 
partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "edged_image.png",
    alt: "Image that tiles poorly",
    caption: "Image that tiles poorly, offset in GIMP" } 
    %>

Do whatever you got to do to smooth it out.
I'm not an artist, but I used a combination of copy+pasting nearby regions and the smudge tool to get the following image:

<%= 
partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "smoothed_image.png",
    alt: "Image that tiles a little better",
    caption: "Image that tiles a litle better" } 
    %>

Now do the same thing, except for with a y offset. 
Thankfully this image already tiles well in a Y direction, so it's not needed.
When you're done, run the same offsets in the opposite direction (negative values) to get your original image back.

<%= 
partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "milky_way_01.png",
    alt: "Milky Way Image",
    caption: "The original image, but tileable" } 
    %>


## Parallax Scrolling in Godot

Create a new scene tree with a `ParallaxBackground > ParallaxLayer > Sprite` hierarchy.
Set the texture of the Sprite to your image.

### Setup texture import settings

Click on the Texture and click on the "Import" tab in the top right.

<%= 
partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "reimport.png",
    alt: "Import settings for the texture",
    caption: "Import settings for the texture" } 
    %>


Set the "Repeat" flag to `Enabled` or `Mirrored`.
Then click "Reimport".

### Setup parallax

Now all you need to do is set the `motion_mirroring` property on the ParallaxLayer to your image's size.
Here's a line of code to do it for you if you like:

```
$ParallaxBackground/ParallaxLayer.motion_mirroring = $ParallaxBackground/ParallaxLayer/Sprite.texture.get_size().rotated(sprite.global_rotation)
```

In the `_process` function, scroll the ParallaxBackground.
You can also modify it by the player's velocity.
Supposedly, if you have a Camera2D node it will auto-scroll the background.

```
var scroll = Vector2(0,3) #Some default scrolling so there's always movement.
if player != null:
    scroll += player.velocity / 200
$ParallaxBackground.scroll_offset += scroll
```

And that's it!
