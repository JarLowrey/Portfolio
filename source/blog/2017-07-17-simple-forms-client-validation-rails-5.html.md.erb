Utilizing validation ensures good data integrity.
You should validate on the server (in the model/controller) for security, and on the client to improve the user experience.
It is very simple to set up in rails with the `client_side_validations` gem.

Also, despite the rumors [the gem is actively maintained](https://github.com/DavyJonesLocker/client_side_validations/graphs/contributors).

##Basic Setup

First, add the simple form, validation, and jquery gems to your Gemfile then `bundle install`.
According to the README, order matters.

~~~ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'simple_form'
gem 'client_side_validations'
gem 'client_side_validations-simple_form'
~~~

Modfiy your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` to import the JS logic.
Order definitely matters.

~~~js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require rails.validations
//= require rails.validations.simple_form
~~~

Generate the intializer logic via `rails g client_side_validations:copy_assets`.
You can then view the [initializer](https://github.com/DavyJonesLocker/client_side_validations#initializer) config file at `config/initializers/client_side_validations.rb`.

Open up your simple form and add `validate: true`:

~~~ruby
<%%= simple_form_for @event, validate: true do |f| %>
  <%%= f.input :name %>
  <%%= f.button :submit %>
<%% end %>
~~~

Finally, add some validation to your model.
The following code ensures `:name` cannot be an empty string.

~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, presence: true, allow_blank: false
end
~~~

That's it!
Now fields can be validated on the client instead of forcing the user to submit the form first.

###jQuery

Not everyone wants jQuery in their app, but the cost of re-writing your own verification logic is likely greater than the cost due to including jQuery.
Modern minified jQuery is [84kb](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size), smaller than a small image, and is [virtually guaranteed](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery) to already be cached on a given client's device.
