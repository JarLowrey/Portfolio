#Implementation

So far we've covered the tech stack behind Birdu and how to get a new Phaser project started using an automatic generator.
Now, we'll jump into the weeds of creating a new game.

Please note, this tutorial aims to outline the main development processes involved, but not every nitty-gritty detail.
The final product will be different from the full game, if you want to know how to implement it exactly you should checkout its [code](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu).

If you weren't here [last time](/blog/phaser-birdu-2.html), we covered how to generate a Phaser project with a yeoman generator.

##The Final Product:

[And here's the code on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu-Tutorial)

##Assets

Go ahead and download the assets [from the repository](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu/tree/master/static/assets) and place them into your "static/assets" directory.
Also update the "src/assets.js" file in your generator with the assets you downloaded.
Copy and paste that file [from here](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu/blob/master/src/assets.js).

These assets contain a [Texture Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas) instead of individual images.
A Texture Atlas combines all your images and spritesheets into a single image, and uses JSON to define where the outlines are.
You can use the free [Leshy SpriteSheet Tool](https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/) or the more advanced [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) to create your own.
This will greatly [improve game performance](game-optimizations.html) by reducing draw calls.

##Getting Started with States

As mentioned previously, a state is a 'screen' of the game.
For example: Settings, Menu, Game, Gameover, etc.
A state has a variety of [public methods](http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.State.html#create), the most important of which are `preload`, `create`, and `update`.
After you run the generator, a couple of states will already be created for you: Boot, Preloader, and Game.

Boot and Preload both take the resources outlined in [asset packs](https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Loader.html#pack) created in `assets.js` and load them into the game's cache.
These states also complete some initial game configuration.
If you want to create a loading screen, do so in the Preloader state and only use assets that are loaded in the 'boot' asset pack.
Boot's main job is to load assets for the Preloader state, and the Preloader state loads assets for the rest of the game.

##Making a State

To make a new state use the generator: `yo phaser-plus:state`, this will create the file and add a reference to states.js for loading into the game.
We are just going to focus on the Game state for now (which comes premade), but try it out by creating a Menu state on your own.

Let's take a look at our game state.

~~~ javascript
/*
 * Game state
 *
 * Here's where the magic happens
 */

export default class Game extends Phaser.State {

  create() {}
  update() {}

}
~~~

###TileSprite

It's pretty boring, just a black background so far.
Let's make this a bit more exciting by adding a colorful moving background.
A [TileSprite](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.TileSprite.html) has a repeating texture that can give the appearance of moving.
Combine a couple of these and you can create a [parallax scrolling background](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/parallax-scrolling-a-simple-effective-way-to-add-depth-to-a-2d-game--cms-21510).

The below example uses the [GameObjectFactory](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.GameObjectFactory.html) to instantiate some TileSprites without much code.
The key and frame values are passed in, and the correct image is grabbed from the Texture Atlas in the game cache.
Then, the update function runs every FPS update and seemlessly scrolls the sprite.

~~~ javascript
//in game state
create(){
  this.bg = this.game.add.tileSprite(0, 0, this.game.width, this.game.height, 'spritesheet', 'bg');
  this.bg1 = this.game.add.tileSprite(0, 0, this.game.width, this.game.height, 'spritesheet', 'bg1');
}
update(){
  this.bg.tilePosition.x += 4;
  this.bg1.tilePosition.x += 8;
}
~~~

<%= partial "partials/video.erb", locals: {
    src: "tiled_sky",
    caption:"Two layer parallax scrolling effect",
    mp4: true } %>

Looks good!
But it is still empty, we should add some action.

##Creating a player

Create a new object name 'Player' and make it extend from Phaser.Sprite - `yo phaser-plus:object`.
In this player we will set its image key in the super() call, add an idling animation using frames from that image, and then set the width, height, and [anchor](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Sprite.html#anchor).

~~~ javascript
/*
 * Player
 * ======
 */

export default class Player extends Phaser.Sprite {

  constructor(game) {
    super(game, game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY, 'spritesheet');

    this.animations.add('idling', ['b17-1', 'b17-2', 'b17-3', 'b17-4'], 20, true);
    this.animations.play('idling');

    this.width = 60;
    this.scale.y = this.scale.x; // set height by changing Y scale to preserve image's aspect ratio
    this.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);
  }
  update() {
    // TODO: Stub.
  }
}
~~~

and now import and use this player in the Game state.

~~~ javascript
import Player from '../objects/Player';
export default class Game extends Phaser.State {
  create() {
    //create background...

    this.player = new Player(this.game);
    this.game.add.existing(this.player);
  }
}
~~~

Notice the background is created before the player.
This ensures the player appears on top of the background on the game [stage](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Stage.html) (otherwise it will be hidden behind it).

###Physics Body

This player is pretty boring, as it just hangs in space.
We want our user to be able to control their sprite and have it interact with other sprites.
First, lets enable collisions and ensure the player can't exit the sides of the game.

~~~ javascript
constructor(game) {
  //...include previous stuff

  this.game.physics.arcade.enableBody(this);
  this.body.collideWorldBounds = true;
  this.body.bounce.set(0.4); //bounces when it hits the bottom
  this.body.drag.setTo(70, 70); //bounce eventually fades away
}
update() {
  //create a red box on the physics body over the player
  //Note that in Arcade Physics, the body does not rotate with Sprite, this is fast good enough for Birdu
  this.game.debug.body(this, 'rgba(255,0,0,0.8)');
}
~~~

###Movement

Now, we want the player to have some sophisticated movement.
When the user taps/clicks the screen, the bird should fly to that position.
As it gets close it slows down, stops, and has gravity applied to it.
When flying, the flying/idling animation should be sped up, and it should return to normal when stopped.
Finally, we want the bird to look in the direction it flies, and return to horizontal when it stops.
Whew!
That's a lot to implement, let's take a look at the final product:

~~~ javascript
update(){
  this.move();
}

move() {
  this.animations.getAnimation('idling').speed = 25;
  let playerSpd = 300;
  let minDistToGoal = this.width / 5;

  if (!this.goal_point) { //define if undefined
    this.goal_point = new Phaser.Point(0, 0);
  }
  const distToPointer = Phaser.Point.distance(this, this.goal_point);

  //detect mouse/tap clicks, and update player's desired destination
  if (this.game.input.activePointer.isDown) {
    this.goal_point.x = this.game.input.activePointer.x;
    this.goal_point.y = this.game.input.activePointer.y;

    this.goTowardsLastActivePointer = true;
  }

  //move player towards his desired destination and turn it off when he reaches it
  if (this.goTowardsLastActivePointer) {
    const radians = Phaser.Math.angleBetweenPoints(this, this.goal_point);
    const angle = Phaser.Math.radToDeg(radians);
    this.angle = angle;
    this.scale.y = (Math.abs(angle) > 90) ? -Math.abs(this.scale.y) : Math.abs(this.scale.y);

    if (distToPointer < minDistToGoal) {
      this.goTowardsLastActivePointer = false; //don't move towards last click's position anymore, you've reached it!
    }

    const slowDownDist = this.width / 2;
    playerSpd = Phaser.Math.linear(0, playerSpd, Math.min(slowDownDist, distToPointer) / slowDownDist);
    this.game.physics.arcade.velocityFromAngle(angle, playerSpd, this.body.velocity);
  }
  //NOT MOVING
  else {
    this.animations.getAnimation('idling').speed = 10; //slow down wing flaps
    this.body.gravity.y = 100; //restart gravity

    this.stabilizeRotation();
  }
}

stabilizeRotation() {
  const absRot = Math.abs(this.body.rotation);
  const rotationDir = (absRot > 90) ? 1 : -1;
  const rotationDelta = (absRot < 180 && absRot > 0) ? rotationDir * Phaser.Math.sign(this.body.rotation) : 0;
  this.body.rotation += rotationDelta;
}
~~~

There's a lot going on here, so take your time absorbing it.
Note that the player's speed is being set via its body's velocity, the engine takes care of actually moving the Sprite once this is set.
Here's what it all looks like now:

    src: "player_movement",
    caption:"Cool player movement",
    webm: true } %>

##Pooling Sprites

Now that our player can move about, we need to create some enemies to hunt down/avoid - `yo phaser-plus:object`, extend Sprite, and name it "Enemy".
We are also going to need a Pool to efficiently allocate these enemies - `yo phaser-plus:object` and name it "Pools" (do not give it a parent, choose "None").
[Pooling](game-optimizations.html#heroes-never-die) allows efficient reuse of game objects and is integral for performance.

First, we are going to setup our Pools class.
This will handle preallocation and revival for all the [Phaser Groups](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Group.html) that we use in the game.
A Phaser.Group is container for [display objects](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/global.html#DisplayObject) such as Sprites, Images, Text, and much more.
They are useful for sprite recycling, batch transformations (all children can be rotated/moved/scaled if that action is done on a group), nested hierarchies and more.
This Pools class is pretty simple: essentially just a JS object/hash that references these powerful Group Objects by a given key, and can be setup using JSON from our Game's create() method.

~~~ javascript
export default class Pools {

  constructor(game, spritesInfo) {
    this.game = game;

    this.pools = {};

    //this can handle the pooling of multiple sprite classes,
    //all indexed by the given key from 'spritesInfo'
    for (let className in spritesInfo) {
      const newPool = this.game.add.group();
      const poolInfo = spritesInfo[className];

      newPool.classType = poolInfo['class']; //set the class to use when expanding
      newPool.createMultiple(poolInfo['count']); //preallocate

      this.pools[className] = newPool;
    }
  }

  getPool(className) {
    return this.pools[className];
  }
}
~~~

And add it to the global game object so that it can be accessed everywhere:

~~~ javascript
import Enemy from '../objects/Enemy';
import Pools from '../objects/Pools';
//...

export default class Game extends Phaser.State {
  create() {
    //...
    this.game.spritePools = new Pools(this.game, {
      'Enemy': {
        'class': Enemy,
        'count': 25
      }
    });
  }
}
~~~

Now, when we need a new enemy we can quickly recycle from the global `spritePools` object using the 'Enemy' key, and can do so anywhere that has a reference to the `game` object.

~~~ javascript
const sprite = this.game.spritePools.getPool(key).getFirstDead(true); //autoExpand if all alive
sprite.reset();
~~~

##Enemy

The Pools class is working fine, but the enemies it is recycling are pretty boring.
At this point it's just a normal sprite, time to fix that.
We want our enemies to random choose a random bird sprite, random speed, start at the edges of the world, and die when they leave the scene (thus freed up for recycling).

~~~ javascript
export default class Enemy extends Phaser.Sprite {

  get player() {
    return this.game.state.states.Game.player;
  }
  static get maxBirdFrame() {
    return 27;
  }
  static get twoFrameAnimations() {
    return [6, 8, 14, 15, 19, 22, 24];
  }
  static get flapFPS() {
    return 20;
  }

  constructor(game) {
    super(game, 0, 0, 'spritesheet');

    this.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);

    //create all animations at construction (when preallocated in the Pools) to avoid perf hit at run time
    for (var i = 0; i < Enemy.maxBirdFrame; i++) {
      const animationFrames = Enemy.getFlyingFrames(i);
      this.animations.add(Enemy.birdFrameName(i), animationFrames, Enemy.flapFPS * (animationFrames.length / 4), true);
    }

    //enable physics body, kill sprite if it moves out of bounds
    this.game.physics.arcade.enableBody(this);
    this.checkWorldBounds = true;
    this.outOfBoundsKill = true;
  }

  reset() {
    super.reset();

    this.speed = null;

    //play one of the random animations that were created in the constructor
    const randomEnemyFrame = Phaser.Math.between(0, Enemy.maxBirdFrame);
    this.animations.play(Enemy.birdFrameName(randomEnemyFrame));

    this.setSpriteSize();
    this.setAtSidesOfScreen();
  }

  setAtSidesOfScreen() {
    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
      this.width = Math.abs(this.width); //face right
      this.x = 0;
      this.body.velocity.x = 300;
    } else {
      this.width = -Math.abs(this.width); //face left
      this.x = this.game.world.width;
      this.body.velocity.x = -300;
    }
    this.body.velocity.y = 0;
    this.y = Math.random() * this.game.world.height;
  }

  setSpriteSize() {
    const playerArea = Math.abs(this.player.width * this.player.height);
    const newArea = Phaser.Math.random(playerArea * 0.5, playerArea * 1.2);

    // Find the new width from the given newArea
    const aspectRatio = Math.abs(this.width / this.height);
    const newWidth = Math.sqrt(newArea * aspectRatio);

    this.width = newWidth;
    this.scale.y = this.scale.x;
  }

  //turn a sprite number and frame animation number into the image's frame name in cache
  //example: Enemy.birdFrameName(10,2) returns "b10-1"
  static birdFrameName(spriteNum, frameNum) {
    if (frameNum != undefined) {
      return 'b' + spriteNum + '-' + frameNum;
    } else {
      return 'b' + spriteNum;
    }
  }

  //given a bird's sprite number, create an array with all its frame names.
  //Some bird animations have 2 frames, the rest have 4
  //example: Enemy.getFlyingFrames(10) returns ["b10-1","b10-2","b10-3","b10-4"]
  static getFlyingFrames(spriteNum) {
    const numFrames = (Enemy.twoFrameAnimations.includes(spriteNum)) ? 2 : 4;

    var frameNames = [];
    for (var i = 1; i <= numFrames; i++) {
      frameNames.push(Enemy.birdFrameName(spriteNum, i));
    }

    return frameNames;
  }
}
~~~

And here's what it looks like!

##Making it a Game

So now we have a player and some performant enemies, but no goals or [juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg).
To fix this we'll add a spawning timer, collision handling for the enemies/Player, some particle effects, a Gameover state, and a score tally.
To create the GameOver state run `yo phaser-plus:state` and name it `GameOver`.
Next, we will perform all of our needed setup in the Game State, and add a simple text to the GameOver State

~~~ javascript
//The Game State

create() {
  //...other stuff

  //add an emitter to show little meat crumbs when this player eats something
  this.emitter = this.game.add.emitter(0, 0, 50);
  this.emitter.makeParticles('spritesheet', 'meat');
  this.emitter.setRotation(-720, 720);
  this.emitter.setXSpeed(-100, 100);
  this.emitter.setAlpha(1, 0.1);
  this.emitter.setYSpeed(-100, 0);
  this.emitter.minParticleScale = .5;
  this.emitter.maxParticleScale = 1;
}

showCrumbs(x, y, width, height) {
  this.emitter.width = Math.abs(width);
  this.emitter.height = Math.abs(height);
  this.emitter.y = y;
  this.emitter.x = x;

  this.emitter.start(true, 2000, null, Phaser.Math.between(4, 8));
}

_incrementScore(amt) {
  this.score += Math.round(amt);
  this.scoreLabel.setText(this.score);
}

static enemyCollision(player, enemy) { //groups are second
  this.showCrumbs(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);
  const enemyArea = Math.abs(enemy.width * enemy.height);
  const playerArea = Math.abs(player.width * player.height);

  if (playerArea > enemyArea) {
    const enemyScore = Math.sqrt(enemyArea);
    this._incrementScore(enemyScore);
    enemy.kill();
  } else {
    player.kill();
    this.state.start('GameOver');
  }
}

update() {
  //background tiling...
  const enemies = this.game.spritePools.getPool('Enemy');
  this.game.physics.arcade.collide(this.player, enemies, Game.enemyCollision, null, this);
}
~~~

And don't forget about the GameOver state too:

~~~ javascript
export default class GameOver extends Phaser.State {
  create() {
    const txt = this.add.text(this.game.world.centerX, this.game.world.centerY, 'Game Over!',
      this.game.cache.getJSON('font_styles').score);
    txt.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);

    //start over the game
    this.game.time.events.add(Phaser.Timer.SECOND, () => {
      this.state.start('Game');
    }, this);
  }
}
~~~

    src: "gameplay",
    webm: true } %>

##Next Steps

Here, you've learned Phaser's basics for creating states, sprites, emitters, and more in JavaScript's easy-to-read ES6 syntax.
Again, the code we've written is all [online at GitHub](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu-Tutorial).
However, the app store Birdu is noticeably different in many ways: the player can grow in size, there's a level system with increasing difficulty, little text graphics [tween](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Tween.html) across the screen when an enemy is eaten, there are combos, invincibility, poop splatters, and much more.
If you want to learn how it all works, dive into the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesrlowrey/Birdu) or peruse the [Phaser-CE documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/).

We're not quite done yet.
These three tutorials covered the tech stack, setup, and implementation of a simple Phaser-CE game.
Next we need to know what to do when things go wrong, how do you debug Phaser applications (coming soon)?

As your game becomes more complex, you may also be interested in [game architecture](game-architecture.html) and [performance optimizations](game-optimizations.html).
Thanks for stopping by!
