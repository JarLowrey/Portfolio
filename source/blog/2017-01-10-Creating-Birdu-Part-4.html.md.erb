<span class="caps">T</span>his is a bit of an aside an our Birdu journey, but an absolutely essential one.
Debugging.
Now that we have a scaffold up and running, we need to learn how to debug the issues that arise.
There are a ton of different ways you can find issues with your code, and a plethora of different tools you can use.
Even though we haven't covered Cordova yet, we'll throw in some Cordova debugging tips in at the end too.

Pros of HTML5 and Phaser debugging can feel free to skip on to the [next article](), it covers $TOPIC.
If you weren't here [last time](/blog/Creating-Birdu-Part-3.html), we covered how to start making a Phaser game.

##debugging!

code/low level = JS - view source (F12), console printing, debugger command, insert breakpoints in code, stepping thru code

Game/medium level = Phaser Debug util library

environment = high/user level = BrowserSync
