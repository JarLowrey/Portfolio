##Howdy

I'm a full-stack web engineer that studied Machine Learning at Georgia Tech and has published multiple video games.
[Here's my resume as of Oct 27, 2021](/docs/James_Lowrey_Resume-10-27-21.pdf)

From 2019-Now I work at the Port of Seattle where I am the lead dev for an internal project/contract management website built in Angular and Entity Framework (C#). 

From 2016-2017 I worked at Epic Systems, an EHR company, where I did JS/Jquery, prototyped a VB->C# backend migration, and updated Mumps DB code.

I graduated Georgia Tech with an MS in CS and a specialization in Machine Learning in 2019.
Before that, I majored in CS Eng. at Ohio State University with a minor in Bio and Premed.

During undergrad I interned at [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/) and [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx), while also TAing an algorithms course and contributing to medical research on liver cancer.
